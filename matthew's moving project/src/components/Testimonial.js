           <p>Fantastic job. Hired them for a long distance move. They coordinated everything with multiple family members while I was overseas. Moving can be stressful enough, but these guys made it easy. Very responsive, friendly and professiona..</p>

           <p>I could not have had better team of guys moving me. They were on time and their work ethic was impeccable. I enjoyed the relationships they had with each other as well. They all seem to work very well together. I would recommend your company to anyone. Not only the workers, but Holly was also a very pleasant person to talk to as well..</p>

           <p>Very Good Job by the crew. Two of then were from another company (sub-contract). I can’t remember their company name (I think it was Victory or Victoria). Great Job -fast and careful. I asked for a detailed quote and paid for the full moving instead of by the hour. It helps as everyone focus on doing a good job, instead of just rushing through or having to supervise each person to get their best effort.</p>

           <p>This was my first time hiring a moving company to move and I am so glad I choose Matthew’s Nationwide! The crew worked so hard and so fast. They took pride in their work and respected our belongings and home as if it were their own. Everyone was so polite, they arrived promptly on time, and moved our 2 bedroom apartment to our new 3 bedroom house within 4.5 hours! Unbelievable! These guys are freakishly strong, extremely good at what they do, and really work their butt off for you and at a very reasonable price! Make sure you tip them well, they surely earn it!</p>

           <p>Robert and Chris were my movers for the day, they arrived promptly at 8 am in the morning. They immediately got to work moving everything in the truck. Professionally wrapped the couch, table, and dressers, and layed down moving blankets. They were done within 2 hours and, transported everything over. and unpacked everything.

They did the move in what would’ve taken me and some friends 2 or 3 times as long so they were definitely worth every penny.</p>

           <p>“Moving is a very stressful experience for anybody. Working with Matt and his crew was by far the best experience with moving I have ever had. It is rare in this day and time that a company and its owner make commitments in regards to service and not only live up to each promise, but go so far and above to exceed those expectations. I will gladly pass on your contact information to anyone who needs the same service. Bravo Matt.</p>

           <p>Amazing attention to details….all furniture wrapped in blankets and shrink wrap when appropriate. These guys busted their tails and hustled – charge by the person per hour which makes it easy to calculate costs ahead of time. No hidden charges or add on fees. Best moving experience I’ve ever had!</p>

           <p>These guys were awesome!! Super nice, professional, and efficient. They had everything wrapped and packed in no time. Even with a little commute, they were done in 4 hours. They hauled ass!! Very rarely do people in the service industry exceed my expectations and these 2 nailed it. I wouldn’t have asked for more and would use them in a heartbeat for any future move. Thanks guys for taking some of the stress out of moving!! a 10, I would!.</p>

They moved my 1,000sq ft apartment across town in about 3 hours.

They were clean, super efficient, polite, and most importantly they actually know how to move furniture.

I’ll never do my own moving again, I highly recommend these guys and will use them again.s crew.</p>

From his professional demeanor and attention to detail when moving our things to his outstanding communication skills and respect and consideration towards us until the end, we were super impressed! He wrapped everything carefully and he and his coworker moved all of it with an extreme amount of care. White glove service until the end and very reasonable in his pricing! Five stars – highly recommended!!f moving!! a 10, I would!</p>

           <p>Matt and his crew were fast and pleasant. (They were also about $700 less than our next-lowest moving estimate.) They got our stuff from a walkup apartment in Northern Virginia to a house in Florida with no trouble at all. And Matt was even very patient when I called and emailed about 400 times with pre-move jitters.

           <p>Through every step of the process Matt was fantastic. He was responsive to every question and moved us out without any troubles. Most movers will try to nickel and dime you or find some way to add a fee – Matt gave us a fair rate and worked his hardest to get the whole process over quickly. I can’t recommend him more enthusiastically- truly great to work with.</p>
