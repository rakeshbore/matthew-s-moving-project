            <p>We have dealt with many types of customers. There are no difficult customers, just difficult situations. We have dealt with everything from the simplest move to the most complex move.</p>

            <h4>Describe a recent project you are fond of. How long did it take?</h4>
            <p>Recently, we had a move from Annandale, VA to Austin, TX. The move required packing of the entire house, wrapping of all the furniture, 4 days of storage, unloading/unwrapping/unpacking in Austin. Almost every item was an antique. The move went flawlessly, not one item was damaged, and the customer was extreme</p>

            <h4>What advice would you give a customer looking to hire a moving company in your area of work?</h4>
            <p>STAY AWAY FROM VAN LINES!!!! Van lines differ from companies like us because they use tractor trailers and combine sometimes 10-15 moves in one truck. Your items are more likely to get lost, stolen or broken. They often hire unskilled labor. Sometimes it can take 2-3 months to get your stuff.

            <h4>What questions should customers think through before talking to moving professionals about their project?</h4>
            <p>Think about getting 2 quotes for your move. One with packing and one without packing. A lot of times, the packing can cost more than the move itself.</p>
